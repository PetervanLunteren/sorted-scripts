# NOTES:

# - you'll need to add the --drive-shared-with-me flag if I do not own the folder. Like:
rclone copy --drive-shared-with-me --progress "gdrive:Addax/Verified Training Images" "C:\Users\smart\Downloads\20240711_grant_verified_imgs"

# If you're seeing "Duplicate object found in source - ignoring" there are duplicates in the Google Drive folder. You can check which ones with the following command:
rclone dedupe "gdrive:Hawaii spp model"
